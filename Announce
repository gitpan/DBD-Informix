Subject: ANNOUNCE: DBD::Informix Version 0.95 released

The next release of DBD::Informix, version 0.95, has been uploaded to CPAN.
It will be available worldwide in a day or three.

DBD::Informix is the driver code that enables Perl 5.004 or 5.005 to access
Informix databases via the DBI module (you'll need the code for both DBI
version 1.02 or later and DBD::Informix).  You should be planning to
upgrade to at least version Perl 5.004_04 as some software in the DBI
family will require this version (eg DBI::Shell).  The DBD::Informix and
DBI code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI

   *******************************************************************
   **    When you successfully build DBD::Informix v0.95, please    **
   **      use the ItWorks script to report your configuration      **

                                GREAT NEWS
Informix will be officially supporting DBD::Informix starting with the next
release.  And Informix R&D engineers will be doing the coding.  So, with
the next release, which will probably be 1.00 (because software companies
do not, I'm told, release 0.xy versions of products), will be supported by
Informix.  With the 1.00 version, if you have support for your Informix
products, then you will be able to get help for DBD::Informix too.  If you
do not have support, then you will have to continue to use the mailing
lists.  I will no longer be doing all the coding etc.  I will still be an
advisor to the people handling DBD::Informix.  And please be patient until
the supported release is available, and be patient with the Tech Support
people who will have to learn how to deal with this product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


New in release 0.95:
* Trying to get to a state where release 1.00 is sensible.  Hence, DBI
  compliance has been an issue that has been addressed.
* Preliminary support for XPS (8.x) database servers.  Versions of XPS
  prior to 8.30 do not support blobs or stored procedures.
* New $dbh attributes for XPS support - ix_ServerVersion, ix_BlobSupport
  and ix_StoredProcedures.
* Various extra documents in Notes sub-directory.
* No longer records INFORMIXDIR and INFORMIXSERVER in Informix.pm during
  build; PAUSE/CPAN was confused by absence of Informix.pm file.
* Another attempt at providing Bundle::DBD::Informix support.
* Basic support for long table and column (and owner) names.
* Use absolute pathnames for shared libraries unless the environment
  variable DBD_INFDORMIX_RELOCATABLE_INFORMIXDIR is set.  Should mean that
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH et al are not required at run time, which should improve
  support for web servers.  INFORMIXDIR and INFORMIXSERVER must be set,
  though.
* New $sth attribute ix_Fetchable indicates whether you can (and therefore
  must) do fetches on this statement handle.
* Attribute ix_AutoErrorReport is officially obsolete.  You get a warning
  that you are using an obsolete attribute.  In future, you won't.
* Attribute ix_StatementText is deprecated; use the DBI standard
  attribute Statement instead.
* Add ItWorks shell script to report working versions in a standard manner.

Still to do:
* Investigate whether using sqlda structures in place of SQL descriptors
  makes a significant difference to the performance of DBD::Informix.
  Note that although this has previously been described as a necessary
  precursor to providing support for Informix-ESQL/C v4.x or earlier
  versions, there are actually no longer any plans to provide support
  for ESQL/C versions prior to 5.00 in DBD::Informix.
* Ensure that NT support works more nearly out of the box.
* Support for LongReadLen et al, maybe.

Next release: 1.00
* This should, with luck, have full IUS support, and decent support for
  builds on NT.  And it should conform fairly closely to the DBI
  specification.
* The next release will be version 0.96 if the 0.95 release doesn't work
  properly with:
	perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::Informix'

Apologies:
* I've not updated the working versions file with those who have told me
  about working versions.
* I may have omitted to include contributions from some people in this
  version.  Even worse, I may have accidentally failed to attribute some
  changes.  If you feel slighted, let me know.
* There appears to be a problem with ix_AutoErrorReport.  Since you should
  be using PrintError instead, please don't try to report the bug; assume
  ix_AutoErrorReport is about to vanish and use PrintError instead.
* I wish the IUS support was more complete, but I found omissions in the
  Informix documentation which side-tracked me instead of allowing me to
  actually code DBD::Informix.
* The documentation has not been overhauled as thoroughly as I'd like.

Let me know of problems, as usual, and solutions too when you have them.

Enjoy!
