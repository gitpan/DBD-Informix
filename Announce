Subject: ANNOUNCE: Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 1.04.PC1 (2002-11-21) released

Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 1.04.PC1 (2002-11-21) has been uploaded to CPAN.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (also known as DBD::Informix) is
the driver code that enables Perl 5.005 or later to access Informix
databases via the DBI module.  You will need the code for DBI version
1.14 or later as well.  You should be planning to upgrade to at least
version Perl 5.8.0.  The code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build Informix Database Driver for Perl,
** use the ItWorks (Perl) script to report your configuration to the
** maintenance team at either dbdinfmx@us.ibm.com (yes, this is a change
** from the 1.00.PC2 release), and copy Jonathan Leffler.  Note that
** ItWorks does not send email to anybody; you have to do that yourself.

New in release 1.04:
* This release is supported by Jonathan Leffler.  It isn't clear what
  IBM's official stance on the product is.  However, they do support
  DBD::DB2 so there is likely to be minimal objection to this work.
* This release provides support for INSERT cursors.
* This release provides support for UPDATE of blobs (BYTE and TEXT).
* This release provides semi-tested support for BEGIN WORK WITHOUT
  REPLICATION.
* This release works with ClientSDK 2.80; the prior versions of
  DBD::Informix do not because the version string changed radically.
* Has better support for non-standard Perl installations.
* You can tell DBD::Informix to avoid testing smart blobs if you have
  IDS 9.x but no smart blob spaces.  You can also say which smart blob
  space to use if you don't want to use 'sbspace'.
* Fix up file locations so it works better with CPAN.

Release 1.03:
* Functionally the same as 1.04, but with the wrong Announce file.  It's
  amazing how you never spot these problems until too late.

As always, see the ChangeLog file for details about what has changed.
