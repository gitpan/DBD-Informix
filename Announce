Subject: ANNOUNCE: IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2007.0226 (2007-02-25) released

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2007.0226 (2007-02-25) has been uploaded to CPAN.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (also known as DBD::Informix) is
the driver code that enables Perl 5.6.1 or later to access Informix
databases via the DBI module (but if you are not already using Perl
5.8.8 - or any later version - you should be planning to upgrade).  You
will need the code for DBI version 1.38 or later as well (v1.54 - or any
later version - is recommended).  The code for DBD::Informix is
available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build this module, use the ItWorks (Perl)
** script to report your configuration to the maintenance team (meaning
** Jonathan Leffler) at dbd.informix@gmail.com.
** The ItWorks script does not send email to anybody; you have to do
** that yourself.

New in release 2007.0226:
* Support for CSDK 3.00.
* Minor bug fixes.
* No exploitation of new features in DBI.

New in release 2005.02:
* The changes here are all related to improved diagnostics during the
  build process.  For example, esqlcc works in debug mode once more.
* Fix bug with INT8 handling on 64-bit platforms.
* Identify dubious Solaris linker flags (-z ignore is the trouble maker;
  -z lazyload is the memorable one; -z combreloc usually occurs with
  them and might or might not be damaging).
* Identify dubious AIX compiler flags (-qlanglvl=ansi).
* Add DBD_INFORMIX_NO_RESOURCE environment variable for under-privileged
  Informix users (those with CONNECT privilege only).
* Add DBD_INFORMIX_NO_DBCREATE environment variable for a different
  class of under-privileged users (those not permitted to create
  databases because of ONCONFIG parameter DBCREATE_PERMISSION).
* These mean that if there is a database to which you can connect, you
  can test DBD::Informix and have good (though not perfect) confidence
  that all is OK.

New in release 2005.01:
* Various minor bug fixes made as reported - see ChangeLog.
* Release required to handle Informix ClientSDK 2.90, which includes
  ESQL/C 2.90.  The previous release (CSDK 2.81, included ESQL/C 9.51),
  and the older DBD::Informix compilation based decisions off the ESQL/C
  version, rejecting 2.90 as obsolete and unusable.
* Note that a number of obsolete versions of ESQL/C are no longer supported.

Known problem:
* t/t91udts.t sometimes warns about an uninitialized variable on
  subroutine entry.  It seems to be harmless - but it is very irksome.

Support email address:
* This release is supported by Jonathan Leffler <dbd.informix@gmail.com>.
* You may also report your bugs via the CPAN resolution tracking system:
    http://rt.cpan.org/
* Such bug reports can be sent by email to bug-DBD-Informix@rt.cpan.org;
  they also get sent to dbd.informix@gmail.com, etc.

As always, see the ChangeLog file for details about what has changed.
