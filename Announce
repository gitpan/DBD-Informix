Subject: ANNOUNCE: DBD::Informix Version 0.55 released

The next release of DBD::Informix, version 0.55, has been uploaded to CPAN.
It will be available worldwide in a day or three.

DBD::Informix is the driver code that enables Perl 5.003 to access Informix
databases via the DBI module (you'll need the code for both DBI version 0.81
and DBD::Informix).  The code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/perl/DBI

* This is primarily a bug-fix release.

New in this release:
* You should be able to download DBD::Informix from the DBI home pages at
  Hermetica listed above (the 0.54 version worked OK).
* Changes in Informix-specific attribute names as forecast.
* Fix SQLSTATE bug with 5.0x ESQL/C.
* Fix SQLNCHAR bug with 5.0x ESQL/C.
* Fix core dump for t/nulls01.t and t/nulls02.t with 5.0x ESQL/C.
* Fix unwanted error message in t/dbase.t with 5.0x ESQL/C.
* Fix EXIT_FAILURE problem for SunOS 4.1.3.

Still to do:
* Investigate whether using sqlda structures in place of SQL descriptors
  makes a significant difference to the performance of DBD::Informix.
* Integrate sqlcmd.sh into the build more thoroughly.  Document it.  Make
  it bomb-proof (for example, it fails horribly if you don't have a '-d'
  option on the command line because there isn't a way to connect to a
  database.
* Add info_cols and info_tables methods somewhere.

Let me know of problems, as usual, and solutions too when you have them.

Enjoy!
