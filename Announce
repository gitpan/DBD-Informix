Subject: ANNOUNCE: DBD::Informix Version 0.59 released

The next release of DBD::Informix, version 0.59, has been uploaded to CPAN.
It will be available worldwide in a day or three.

DBD::Informix is the driver code that enables Perl 5.003 or 5.004 to access
Informix databases via the DBI module (you'll need the code for both DBI
version 0.90 and DBD::Informix).  The code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://www.arcana.co.uk/technologia/perl/DBI

New in this release:
* 

Still to do:
* Add support for IUS data types.
* Try to reproduce the problems reported by Kenji Hino <kenji@alcatraz.net>
  and then fix them.  It is related null blobs and SQL error -608.
* Resolve -R option on Solaris and equivalents for getting path name of
  Informix shared libraries into DBD::Informix shared library, so you don't
  need as much environment set at run-time.
* Investigate whether using sqlda structures in place of SQL descriptors
  makes a significant difference to the performance of DBD::Informix.
* Integrate sqlcmd.sh into the build more thoroughly.  Document it.  Make
  it bomb-proof (for example, it fails horribly if you don't have a '-d'
  option on the command line because there isn't a way to connect to a
  database.

Let me know of problems, as usual, and solutions too when you have them.

Enjoy!
