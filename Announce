Subject: ANNOUNCE: IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2007.0903 (2007-09-03) released

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2007.0903 (2007-09-03) has been uploaded to CPAN.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (also known as DBD::Informix) is
the driver code that enables Perl 5.6.1 or later to access Informix
databases via the DBI module (but if you are not already using Perl
5.8.8 - or any later version - you should be planning to upgrade).  You
will need the code for DBI version 1.38 or later as well (v1.54 - or any
later version - is recommended).  The code for DBD::Informix is
available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build this module, use the ItWorks (Perl)
** script to report your configuration to the maintenance team (meaning
** Jonathan Leffler) at dbd.informix@gmail.com.
** The ItWorks script does not send email to anybody; you have to do
** that yourself.
