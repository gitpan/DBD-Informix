Subject: ANNOUNCE: Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 1.03.PC1 (2002-11-21) released

Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 1.03.PC1 (2002-11-21) has been uploaded to CPAN.

This is a purely administrative release.  It changes the version number
from 1.00.PC1 to 1.00.PC2 solely to fix the email addresses for reporting
problems.  Functionally, it is identical to 1.00.PC1 - bugs and all.  All
previous releases of DBD::Informix are scheduled to be removed from CPAN on
2002-02-04.  The copyright information has been extended to recognize that
IBM owns Informix.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (previously known as DBD::Informix)
is the driver code that enables Perl 5.004 or 5.005 to access Informix
databases via the DBI module.  You will need the code for DBI version 1.14
as well.  You should be planning to upgrade to at least version Perl
5.004_04 as some software in the DBI family will require this version (eg
DBI::Shell).  The code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build Informix Database Driver for Perl,
** use the ItWorks (Perl) script to report your configuration to the
** maintenance team at either dbd-informix@informix.com (up to
** 2002-06-30) or to dbd-informix@us.ibm.com (from 2002-07-01, though
** you may try this address now if you wish).  Note that ItWorks does
** not send email to anybody; you have to do that yourself.

New in release 1.10:
* This release is supported by Informix. That means that Informix
  R&D engineers will both add new features and fix problems. 
* This release provides support for INSERT cursors.
* This release provides support for UPDATE of blobs (BYTE and TEXT).

New in release 1.00:
* This is the first release supported by Informix. That means that Informix
  R&D engineers will both add new features and fix problems. That also means 
  that Informix customers will be able to purchase support from Informix for
  IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl.
* This release provides a (limited) support for UDTs - see README for details.
* See the ChangeLog file for details about what has changed.
