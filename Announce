Subject: ANNOUNCE: Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 0.97003 (2000-02-07) released

Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 0.97003 (2000-02-07) has been uploaded to CPAN.
It will be available worldwide in a day or three.

Informix Database Driver for Perl (previously known as DBD::Informix)
is the driver code that enables Perl 5.004 or 5.005 to access Informix
databases via the DBI module.  You will need the code for DBI version
1.13 as well.  You should be planning to upgrade to at least version
Perl 5.004_04 as some software in the DBI family will require this
version (eg DBI::Shell).  The code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI

** When you successfully build Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 0.97003 (2000-02-07),
** use the ItWorks script to report your configuration to the maintenance
** team.  Privacy issue: ItWorks does not send email to anybody; you have
** to do that yourself.

New in release 1.00:
* This is the first release supported by Informix. That means that Informix
  R&D engineers will both add new features and fix problems. That also means 
  that Informix customers will be able to purchase support from Informix on
  DBD::Informix.
* This release provides a (limited) support for UDTs - see README for details.
