Subject: ANNOUNCE: DBD::Informix Version 0.58 released

The next release of DBD::Informix, version 0.58, has been uploaded to CPAN.
It will be available worldwide in a day or three.

Please note the change of contact address.  As of 17th January 1998, I do
not actually work for Informix.  Email sent to johnl@informix.com will not
be delivered to me -- it will bounce or vanish into the great bit bucket in
the sky (aka /dev/null).

DBD::Informix is the driver code that enables Perl 5.003 or 5.004 to access
Informix databases via the DBI module (you'll need the code for both DBI
version 0.90 and DBD::Informix).  The code is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://www.arcana.co.uk/technologia/perl/DBI

New in this release:
* Corrected README file (0.57 had the wrong files released as READMEs; sorry).
* Integrated support for NT into Makefile.PL (with trivial changes elsewhere).
* Amended README to be more stringent on using C compiler to create shared
  libraries.
* Fix bug for logged (non-ANSI) databases on BEGIN WORK when AutoCommit Off.
* Amend the place-holder parsing routine to ignore ':alpha' place-holders
  because they are syntactically indistinguishable from Informix's
  database:table notation.

Still to do:
* Add support for IUS data types.
* Try to reproduce the problems reported by Kenji Hino <kenji@alcatraz.net>
  and then fix them.  It is related null blobs and SQL error -608.
* Resolve -R option on Solaris and equivalents for getting path name of
  Informix shared libraries into DBD::Informix shared library, so you don't
  need as much environment set at run-time.
* Investigate whether using sqlda structures in place of SQL descriptors
  makes a significant difference to the performance of DBD::Informix.
* Integrate sqlcmd.sh into the build more thoroughly.  Document it.  Make
  it bomb-proof (for example, it fails horribly if you don't have a '-d'
  option on the command line because there isn't a way to connect to a
  database.

Let me know of problems, as usual, and solutions too when you have them.

Enjoy!
