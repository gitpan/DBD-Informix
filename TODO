A List of Things That Need to be Done to Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 0.97003 (2000-02-07)

At the moment, everything has an added date of 1999-12-29, even though
many of the items have been valid issues since version 0.25 back in 1996.

T.001: Added 1999-12-29
    Find out why t/t75blob.t sometimes fails.  Requires modification to
    test so it actually does something, of course.  The failure is
    intermittent.  Seems to be memory corruption of some sort related to
    how blobs are handled.  It is proving very difficult to track.

T.002: Added 1999-12-29
    Fix support for LVARCHAR types.

T.003: Added 1999-12-29
    Add support for DISTINCT types.  This should not be hard; it
    requires a change to the code which analyzes the type number to
    recognize that the DISTINCT bit is set.

T.004: Added 1999-12-29
    Worry about the DBI specification changes since 1997-01-01, roughly.
    Especially the metadata changes, meaning things like type_info_all.

T.005: Added 1999-12-29
    Worry about decimal number formatting.  The code in decsci.c and
    decsci.h should probably be upgraded.

T.006: Added 1999-12-29
    Worry about ReadLongLen and such attributes.  I still dislike them.

T.007: Added 1999-12-29
    Add full support for bind_param and bind_param_inout.  This should
    help enable updating blobs -- you need the type information.

T.008: Added 1999-12-29
    Revisit the DBIc_ACTIVE_on/off issues.

T.009: Added 1999-12-29
    Find out whether it is really necessary to clean up the statements
    for a $dbh, or the $dbh's for a $drh.  If not, remove the list
    support code in link.c, link.h.

T.010: Added 1999-12-29
	Add support for collection types.

T.011: Added 1999-12-29
	Add support for user-defined types.

T.012: Added 1999-12-29
	Review placing blob data in files.

T.013: Added 1999-12-29
    Review providing a LOAD and UNLOAD capability.  Not a clear cut
    issue.  UNLOAD is pretty simple, but it is hard to do the LOAD data
    validation really well.  And without penalizing everybody with a lot
	of code.

T.014: Added 1999-12-29
    Review the code that formats values on return from the database.  If
    the ESQL/C code will do a decent job formatting everything into a
    string, then it may be possible to simplify most of the code.
    Handling blobs will still be complex.  Also look to refactor the
    huge case statement(s) into separate functions -- the existing code
    has grown and is an horrible mess.
