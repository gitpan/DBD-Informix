Change Log for DBD::Informix, the Informix driver for Perl DBI

Note that none of the records for any of the 0.96 and 0.97 releases will
appear in the official 1.00.PC1 ChangeLog.  These are purely
experimental versions, but learning how to beat PAUSE and CPAN requires
lots of (slow) testing with the results being semi-public.  Further,
these versions will *all* be removed when the official 1.00 release is
ready, or very shortly thereafter, if they are not removed beforehand.
Do not rely on them.  Do not report problems with them.

0.97002 Release
---------------
2000-01-24: Another dummy release, doing more testing of whether we can
            reinstate the code which records INFORMIXDIR and INFORMIXSERVER
            during the build.  We are making progress.

0.97001 Release
---------------
2000-01-19: Another dummy release, doing more testing of whether we can
            reinstate the code which records INFORMIXDIR and INFORMIXSERVER
            during the build.  This was removed in the 0.95 build because
            of problems with PAUSE and CPAN.

0.97.PC1 Release
----------------
2000-01-18: Another dummy release, testing whether we can reinstate the
            code which records $INFORMIXDIR and $INFORMIXSERVER during
            configuration (perl Makefile.PL).  This was removed in the 0.95
            build because of problems with PAUSE and CPAN.

0.96.PC2X2 Release
------------------
2000-01-17: Another dummy release testing PAUSE/CPAN and version numbers.

0.96.PC2X1 Release
------------------
2000-01-17: Another dummy release testing PAUSE/CPAN and version numbers.

0.96.PC2 Release
----------------
2000-01-17: Another dummy release testing PAUSE/CPAN and version numbers.

0.96.PC1X1 Release
------------------
2000-01-17: Another dummy release testing PAUSE/CPAN and version numbers.

0.96.PC1 Release
----------------
2000-01-17: Another dummy release testing PAUSE/CPAN and version numbers.

0.95.PC1X2 Release
------------------
2000-01-14: Dummy release testing PAUSE/CPAN and version numbers.

0.95 Release
------------
1999-12-30: Create ItWorks script to report on working versions.  Update
            README; annotate DELIMIDENT as a source of test failures on NT
            in particular, and probably in general.  Fix esqltest.ec and
            esqlbasic.ec to accomodate error +25507, as reported by Carrie
            Coy <carriec@doc.state.vt.us>.  Note that all other ESQL/C
            error messages are negative, but it only takes one exception to
            cause problems.  Set version to 0.95 and dispatch to PAUSE and
            CPAN.  With luck, DBD::Informix gets handed over to Michael
            Kopchenov <myk@informix.com> from now on.  Jonathan Leffler
            remains in place as 'product manager'.
            Wishing everybody a Happy New Millenium (unless you want to
            wait an extra 367 days for the next millenium to begin).
1999-12-30: Create 0.95b2 with more NT-inspired changes from MYK.
1999-12-29: Create 0.95b1 for testing at Informix.  Final release of
            version 0.95 scheduled for 1999-12-31.  Includes some NT build
            fixes from Michael Kopchenov <myk@informix.com>.
1999-12-28: Reorganization of Makefile.PL with subroutines at end was
            suggested by Medi Montaseri <medi@CyberShell.com> on
            1998-05-20.  Changes were made for the 0.61 release.
1999-12-21: Added '-qlanglvl=ansi' change to Makefile.PL for AIX suggested
            by Joachim Schrod <jscrod@acm.org> in January 1998, and added
            note about SITEARCHEXP as an alternative to INSTALLSITEARCH.
            Long overdue -- sorry Joachim.
1999-12-04: Add notes on URL of Japanese translation of DBD::Informix POD
            by Kawai Takanori <kawai@nippon-rad.co.jp>.  Modify more tests
            to skip when appropriate.
1999-11-27: Modify esqltest to allow shared memory connections.  Modify the
            multiple connection tests so that they are skipped.  Update notes
            to match.
1999-11-18: Remove the 'record INFORMIXDIR and INFORMIXSERVER' code and
            reinstate Informix.pm (instead of Informix.pm.PL) because PAUSE
            and CPAN get confused when there is no Informix.pm file.  Use
            SQL_COLNAMELEN instead of NAMESIZE for the column names in
            dbdimp.ec and dbdattr.ec after bug report and proposed (but
            different) patch from Nick Osborn <nick@bibliotech.net>.  Pass
            $NTConfiguration as argument to find_informixdir_and_esql(), a
            problem afflicting NT builds first reported by Ti Lian Hwang
            <tilh@sin-co.sg.dhl.com>.  Add ix_ServerVersion, ix_BlobSupport
            and ix_StoredProcedure attributes to help with XPS support
            (Robert Wyrick <rob@wyrick.org> helped with XPS testing).
            Amend tests and documentation.
1999-11-16: Add Notes/environment.variables after a report from Claude
            Chartier <cbos@pophost.eunet.lu> that it would be helpful to
            have INFORMIXCONTIME etc documented.  Add Notes/web.servers for
            same reason; the notes need to be upgraded to discuss mod_perl
            for Apache.  Reinstate Bundle::DBD::Informix based on what is
            in the DBI 1.13 bundle, which seems to work (unlike the attempt
            at distributing Bundle::DBD::Informix 0.62 as a separate item,
            which fails).
1999-11-10: Add MD5 check sums for source code in MD5-DIGEST.  This will
            allow the DBD::Informix maintenance team to identify any
            changed source files.  Use the md5.verify script to ensure
            that the individual files are OK.  To check that MD5-DIGEST
            itself has not been modified, you run "perl md5.chksum
            MD5-DIGEST" and compare the output with the official value,
            which has to be stored somewhere.  In the short term, it
            will go on a web site (URL to be decided).  All this assumes
            you have the optional Digest::MD5 module on your machine,
            so it is listed in the Bundle::DBD::Informix pre-requisites.
1999-11-02: BugReport needs to be careful of 'id -a' which is an SVR4
            variation on the POSIX.2 standard.  On Solaris, use
            /usr/xpg4/bin/id if available, else '/usr/bin/id -a'; on
            other platforms, assume 'id' lists the auxilliary groups.
            Probably won't be accurate for some SVR4 systems other than
            Solaris, but probably won't matter either.  Problem
            highlighted by Marc Esser <esserma@cerf.net>.
1999-09-23: Decide that next release will be 0.95.  Create the release
            checklist file to help ensure that things are done properly.
            Modify esqlld so that Informix shared libaries are linked with
            absolute pathnames unless DBD_INFORMIX_RELOCATABLE_INFORMIXDIR
            is set in the environment.  Won't help if esqlld is not used,
            as on some machines (eg AIX).

0.62 Release
------------
1999-09-19: Change all dates in this file to use 1999 instead of 99.  Add
            BugReport script to generate information for failure reports,
            and document accordingly.  Uses "perlsubs/esqlc.pl" for common
            subroutines shared with Makefile.PL, so make corresponding
            changes.  Replace DBD::InformixTest (which was never a DBD
            driver) with "perlsubs/InformixTest.pl"; do not install it.
            Modify tests and documentation accordingly.  Improve build on
            AIX 4.2 (no wittering about duplicate symbols).  Move materials
            from hints subdirectory and auxilliary documentation like
            Informix.Licence into (new) Notes sub-directory.
1999-09-17: The DBI headers might be in $INSTALLARCHLIB rather than
            $INSTALLSITEARCH.  This is the case under Debian.  Problem
            reported by Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>.  Also, AIX
            4.2 requires the use of ld to create shared libraries, so do
            not complain on AIX about the use of ld.
1999-08-30: Add notes on SERIAL and $sth->{ix_salerrd}[1] after extensive
            discussions with Kevin Brannen <kbrannen@physiciansdata.com> on
            this and related matters.  Chase down references to fugue.com
            and replace with the updated isc.org equivalents.  Add basic
            support for HOLD cursors (when available, which means with
            AutoCommmit Off -- AutoCommit On always uses HOLD CURSORS;
            think about it).  Bill Rothanburg <brothanb@fll-ro.dhl.com>
            supplied the patch, to whom many thanks.  There are hooks for
            supporting scroll cursors too, but the actual FETCH code
            doesn't know how to handle these.  DBI 1.13 doesn't support any
            attribute on any of the fetch methods, which makes it difficult
            to do much until DBI moves on.  Fix t/t30update.t to work in
            non-US locales - problem reported by Arnar M Hrafnkelsson
            <amh@mbl.is>.
1999-08-23: Add (remarkably simple) fix to error -451 problem, and test
            t/t76blob.t to verify the fix.  Fix supplied by Richard Jones
            <rich@annexia.org>.  Does not appear to fix the t75blob.t core
            dump problem.
1999-07-26: Add Informix.faq file with two questions.  Both questions have
            been asked many times by many people.  Fix mistake in
            documentation of $sth->{ix_sqlerrd} and $sth->{ix_sqlwarn}, a
            problem found by Gerd Mucha <Gerd.Mucha@Sisis.de>.
1999-06-09: Fix top of README file (hint from Veit Jakof <vjakof@baan.nl>).
1999-05-26: Fix warning about ambiguous use of ${DBI::errstr}, again thanks
            to David M Davisson <davisson@emuni.com>.  Maybe ${DBI::errstr}
            should be replaced by ${DBI}::errstr if the braces are
            retained?  However, removing the braces also removes the
            warning.
1999-05-13: Fix CGI examples to use CGI::TR method; info and revisions
            thanks to David M Davisson <davisson@emuni.com>.  Reduce
            verbosity of Makefile.PL in default cases -- leave messages for
            exceptional situations very verbose.
1999-05-11: Remove trailing newline from error messages after suggestion
            from Andrew Pimlott <pimlott@abel.math.harvard.edu>.  Also have
            to modify some of the test code.  Change mind and renumber
            release from 0.61_03 to 0.62.
1999-04-28: Modify README file to clarify still more the prerequisites
            after problems encountered by Cliff J Larson
            <clarson@aisp.net>.  Change references from GCC to EGCS.  Split
            t01stproc.t from t00basic.t.  Combine old t72blob.t and
            t73blob.t into t72blob.t (self-contained test, now).  Revise
            t73blob.t to test UPDATE of blobs; currently fails.  Revise
            reference to arcana.co.uk to symbolstone.org.
1999-04-01: Add $dbh->table_info based on original code from David Bitseff
            <dbitsef@uswest.com>, and t/t56tabinfo.t to test it.  Add
            t/t57tables.t to test $dbh->tables.  Override DBD::_::db::tables
            to get the correct quoting for owner names.
1999-03-31: Remove $style argument from connect_to_test_database method in
            InformixTest package.  Corresponding changes in test suite.
            Increase maximum number of columns in descriptor from 128 to 256.
            Split old-connection test into t/t83oconn.t.  Update README to
            refer to t/t00basic.t instead of t/basic00.t, and deprecate the
            old connection method in t83oconn.t instead of t00basic.t.
1999-02-16: Fix precision on numeric values in dbd_ix_bindsv, as suggested by
            David Haubenstricker <haubend@dominos.com>.
1999-01-11: Fix new variant on password problem in t00basic.t after report
            (with solution) from Jeff DeFay <jfdefay@acm.org>.
1998-12-31: Fix bugs when compiling with ESQL/C 5.08.  Problem reported by
            Larry Timmins <ftiadmin@fhb.clickcharge.com> and Patrick Sweeney
            <ftidev@fhb.clickcharge.com>.
1998-12-14: Commence work on major defects in 0.61_02 release.

0.61_02 Release
---------------
1998-12-14: Go for general release with known 'bad free()' problems.

0.61_01 Release
---------------
1998-12-07; Released internally at Informix.
1998-11-25: Fix the code to detect NT (Win32) using suggestion from Andy
            Williams <andy_williams@pa.press.net>.  Ken Scott
            <kscott@pcisys.net> first identified the problem and sent in an
            alternative fix using an exact match rather than a regular
            expression.
1998-11-23: The code did not get uploaded to CPAN.  Proving tests show that
            there were problems, especially bad frees on blob testing when
            run with 'make test', but not when run with the test.one script.
            Added t/t99clean.t to remove most of the debris from the test
            database, and add warning to README emphasizing this.  Need to
            split dbdimp.ec into components (eg dbdimpdr.ec, dbdimpdb.ec,
            dbdimpst.ec) and amend dbdimp.h to declare newly visible
            functions because it's over 2000 lines, it's too damn big, and
            it's going to grow some more before IUS support is really
            complete.  Drop version numbers from MANIFEST, and tools to
            maintain them.
1998-11-17: Add code from Honza Pazdziora <adelton@fi.muni.cz> which records
            the value of INFORMIXDIR and INFORMIXSERVER used at build time to
            set the defaults at run-time.  Set version 0.61_01 (experimental).
1998-11-09: Add DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLC_LINKAGE environment variable after report
            by Duc H Nguyen <dhn@benvolio.nova.att.com> who states that
            ESQL/C 7.24.UC[56] (probably on HP-UX 10.20) links with static
            libraries by default.  He provided a workaround hacking esql.
            Robert Cowham <CowhamR@logica.com> ran into this problem.
1998-11-04: Revise assert handling so that assertions are off by default.
            Code now ignores DBD_INFORMIX_DISABLE_ASSERT and only responds to
            DBD_INFORMIX_ENABLE_ASSERT instead.
1998-11-03: Remove test for __STDC__ in esqltest.ec -- it causes unwarranted
            problems on, for example, AIX and NT and gives minimal benefit on
            any system, especially since Perl 5.005 has to be compiled by an
            ANSI C compiler (prototype aware compiler).  Reported by both
            David Edge <dedge@ak.blm.gov> and Geoffrey Rommel
            <grommel@sears.com>.
1998-11-02: Add bundles for DBI and DBD::Informix to simplify the builds.
1998-10-29: Merge in threading patch from Jan Iven <j.iven@rz.uni-sb.de>.
1998-10-28: Commence work on IUS compatability.  Abolish DBD_INFORMIX_SERVER;
            DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE should contain required server information
            in the appropriate format.  Add variables DBD_INFORMIX_USERNAME2
            and DBD_INFORMIX_PASSWORD2.  Fix multi-connection tests so that
            they use the username and password information (problem found by
            both Ben Laurie <ben@algroup.co.uk> and Geoffrey Rommel
            <grommel@sears.com>).  Add and use DBD_IX_BOOLEAN macro to fix
            problems with MSVC on NT found by Manish Dharwadker
            <manishd@informix.com>.
1998-10-27: Add examples subdirectory, and initial examples.
1998-09-25: Fix esqlc.h for 7.1x ESQL/C so it explicitly includes value.h,
            thanks to David Edge <dedge@ak.blm.gov>.
1998-09-04: Fix misuse of $user for $pass in t/t00basic.t, thanks to Kevin
            White <kwhite@redroof.com>.
1998-08-13: Version numbering changes.

0.60 Release
------------
1998-08-12: Final tidying up and release.
1998-08-10: Release to Albert W Dorrington <awdorrin@ictest.delcoelect.com>
            as 0.60b1 to give him HP-UX and GCC fixes.  Partially rework the
            t00basic.t test to fix the problems accessing databases which
            require a username and password.
1998-08-06: Fix problem with error -608 originally reported by Kenji Hino
            <kenji@alcatraz.net>, related to handling a null blobs.  Maybe
            this fix also fixed the -451 errors reported by both John Keston
            <jkeston@wamnet.com> and Brian Renaud <renaud@ans.net>; the
            change could plausibly resolve that error too, but none of us was
            able to reproduce the -451 error on demand, so we don't know for
            sure.
1998-08-05: Integrate changes by R Bernstein <rocky@panix3.panix.com> which
            give support for IUS datatype BOOLEAN.  This has not been fully
            tested on an IUS (IDS/UDO) engine, and may not handle nulls
            correctly.  It is not complete IUS support by any stretch of the
            imagination.  Add some new material to the hints directory, even
            though they are not hints about compiling DBD::Informix.
1998-07-30: Revise the data_sources method to include the 'dbi:Informix:'
            prefix mandated by the DBI specification.
1998-07-29: Finish renaming the tests.  Use MSD/NMD technology to create
            directory from which distribution is made -- to ensure that
            correct versions of all library files which are not mastered
            under the DBD/Informix directory are fully up to date.  Drop
            sqlcmd.sh as it is (a) unused and (b) superseded by DBI::Shell.
            Add two new attributes, $sth->{ix_StatementText} and
            $dbh->{ix_DatabaseName}.  Note that $dbh->{Name} returns the name
            of the database when DBI->connect() is called, but the name of
            he current database can be changed by things such as CLOSE
            DATABASE and DATABASE or CREATE DATABASE statements;
            $dbh->{ix_DatabaseName} reports the current database name.  When
            last row is fetched, implicitly close (finish) the cursor, as
            requested by Tim Bunce.  Explicit finish is only required if the
            loop is terminated early.
1998-06-25: Include notes from Yang-Chao lin <ylin@sr.hp.com> about compiling
            on HP-UX with ESQL/C 5.x or 6.x.  Also upgrade the comments about
            IUS types for those who do not know anything other than IUS, such
            as Stephen Pillinger <S.M.Pillinger@cs.bham.ac.uk> who first
            alerted me to this problem.
1998-06-16: Include notes from Alex Shah <ashah@atg.eb.com> on __eprintf().
1998-06-15: Incorporate __eprintf() fix from Bernd Gill <bernd@dsi.co.nz>.
            Include the HP-UX 10.20 build notes from Reed White
            <REED_WHITE@HP-Corvallis-om1.om.hp.com>.  Improve esqltest.ec.
            Add new environment variables DBD_INFORMIX_USE_EPRINTF_CODE and
            DBD_INFORMIX_DISABLE_ASSERT to Makefile.PL.
1998-05-19: Change test to fail after trying to drop table dbd_ix_blobtest
            in t/blob02.t when table exists but cannot be dropped by user.
            Problem found by Nuno Carneiro de Moura <ncmoura@net.mailcom.pt>.
1998-03-11: Version numbering changes.

0.59 Release
------------
1998-03-11: Make a release to try and resolve ongoing problems at AirTouch.
            NB: this release not sent to CPAN.
1998-03-04: Chuck Collins <Chuck.Collins@AirTouch.COM> discovered that the
            dbd_ix_preparse() routine gets confused by DATETIME and INTERVAL
            literals -- it was treating '30:20:10' as '30??' because the
            literals are not inside a string.  Fixed by not recognizing
            Oracle-style numeric place-holders (Oracle-style named place-holders
            were already ignored because they can be confused with dbase:table).
1998-02-20: Chuck Collins <Chuck.Collins@AirTouch.COM> discovered an assertion
            failing in MODE ANSI databases when an UPDATE didn't update any
            rows.  Fix assertion to cover this case.  Testing reveals that if
            you create a database, the logging status, etc, are not set
            correctly.  This also causes an assertion to fire.
1998-02-17: DBI 0.93 released with fix for '.xsi' problem.
1998-02-11: Problem with Informix.xsi resolved.  Needs extra dependency in
            generated Makefile, which is triggered by the DBI version.
1998-02-06: Document problems with DBI 0.92 (no Informix.xsi file).

0.58 Release
------------
1998-01-15: Finish up NT build work, and release in time for the Win32 Perl
            Resource Book deadline (phew) and also just before switching jobs
            from Informix to Visa.  Fix Makefile.PL and README file to make
            warnings about using ld to create shared libraries with gcc more
            stringent.  Kevin White <kwhite@redroof.com> and Michael Chandler
            <mpchandler@fedex.com> both had major problems on HP-UX 10.20
            with this, and the problems were not fully resolved at release
            time.  One issue was that the notation 'ENVVAR=value command' did
            not seem to be setting the environment variable, but Makefile.PL
            assumes this will work.  Maybe it should use Perl's %ENV instead.
1998-01-14: More work on NT builds with help from Ken Scott <ken@apisys.net>
            and Patrick-James Dionisio <dionisio@netscape.com>.
1998-01-13: Use warn instead of die to report lower than ideal DBI version in
            Makefile.PL.  Also make corrections for NT builds based on
            feedback from Ken Scott <kscott@pcisys.net>.
1998-01-12: Fix dbd_ix_preparse() so it does not convert :alpha into ? after
            Chuck Collins <Chuck.Collins@AirTouch.COM> pointed out that
            SELECT * FROM sysmaster:systabnames gives a syntax error in 0.57.
1998-01-07: Initial attempt at integrating Makefile.NT into Makefile.PL.
1998-01-06: Modify Makefile.PL to give a reason for failure when stating that
            you did not read the README file after Michael Chandler
            <mpchandler@fedex.com> ran into problems identifying the source
            of such a failure.
1998-01-05: Update copyright dates.  Change email address for maintainer.
1997-12-03: Simplify the version testing to ignore the lists of libraries.
            The test compilation ensures that everything is OK, or not.
            Also, simply use the local copy of odbctype.h, without checking
            whether any ODBC is available or not.
1997-11-18: Steven Hronek <hronek@lsil.com> asked whether ESQL/C was still
            necessary.  Ensure that README is absolutely clear that it is,
            and mention DBD::ODBC as a possible alternative.

0.57 Release
------------
1997-11-17: Final clean up and testing.  Version 0.56 released.
1997-10-19: Handle the 'esql -libs' process rather differently, because of
            the bug in older versions of the esql script which do not echo
            the name of the netstub library when necessary (a problem found
            by Rodger Anderson <rodger@hpbs2245.boi.hp.com> in July, but only
            now resolved).  Record information about compiling with c4gl only
            in Informix.Licence, after answering questions from Paul Falbe
            <paul@cassens.com>.
1997-10-08: Change the name of the sqlca element of imp_dbh to ix_sqlca to
            avoid the macro renaming used in threaded versions of ESQL/C such
            as on Windows 95 and Windows NT.  This change and success with a
            Windows 95 and Windows NT port reported by Harald Ums
            <Harald.Ums@sevensys.de>.  Also a change to esqlc.h, triggered by
            the need to use sqlproto.h, and use io.h in place of unistd.h in
            ixblob.ec, and do not release 'unreleased' blobs...  Makefile.PL
            still to be upgraded.
1997-10-08: Record Informix ESQL/C's ability to change the environment
            without Perl knowing about it, after the problem found by Jay
            Ludoviconi <jludovic@paging.mot.com> was tracked down.
1997-10-03: Add Working.Versions file after a suggestion by Nuno Carneiro de
            Moura <ncmoura@net.mailcom.pt>
1997-08-13: Add file hints/static.build with info about building statically
            linked Perl executables from Kent S Gordon <kgor@inetspace.com>.
            Clean up function entry and exit reporting.
1997-08-01: Add _tables and _columns metadata methods.
1997-07-29: Update to use the templates from DBI v0.89, etc.  Amend README
            after Kent S Gordon <kgor@inetspace.com> noted that the engine
            version information could be useful.
1997-07-21: Add dbd_ix_preparse() (based on code in DBD::ODBC 0.15) to
            pre-process an SQL statement, replacing Oracle-style :x notation
            with question mark place holders.  This allows DBD::Informix to
            support $sth->{NUM_PARAMS} properly, and reinstates functionality
            present in DBD::Informix 0.24 but summarily removed in version
            0.25.  Interestingly, of course, noone has complained, or even
            commented on this.
1997-07-16: Kenji Hino <kenji@alcatraz.net> found that the test t/blob02.t
            failed for logged OnLine databases because of the changed
            AutoCommit handling; alter the criterion for doing $dbh->commit.
            Jason Bodnar <jcbodnar@mail.utexas.edu> found that the
            documentation for $dbh->do() was faulty; add the undef parameter
            for the unused \%attr documented by DBI.
1997-07-14: Deal with the last of the deprecated attributes.  Work around the
            oddities (changes) introduced by ESQL/C 9.12.

0.56 Release
------------
1997-07-10: Final clean up and testing (and workaround for problem in DBI
            0.85 when connections fail at connect time).
            Version 0.56 released.
1997-07-09: Establish that DBI->connect(...,{AutoCommit=>0}) does not set the
            AutoCommit attribute until after the basic connect operation is
            complete.  DBD::Informix therefore cannot reject connections on
            unlogged databases in the basic connect operation.  Modified
            Informix.Licence after Raj Goel <frostbit@brainlink.com> needed
            to ask questions.  The difficulty with 'newbies' is that they
            quickly cease to be newbies so you need a continuous supply of
            new newbies.  Fix documentation in Informix.pm for AutoCommit,
            and behaviour of ix_InTransaction attribute.  Many thanks to Hank
            Robinson <cudau@csv.warwick.ac.uk> for his help clarifying the
            required behaviour of AutoCommit, and apologies for omitting his
            name in the original version of the 0.56 release notes.
1997-07-08: Make $dbh->{ix_AutoErrorReport} a synonym for $h->{PrintError}.
1997-07-07: Jason Bodnar <jcbodnar@mail.utexas.edu> pointed out that
            $sth->execute() is not returning undef when an error occurs.
1997-06-25: Roderich Schupp <roderich@nodebonn.muc.bmw.de> found a similar
            problem using $dbh->do($stmt, undef, $arg1, $arg2), core dumping
            in the link code.  This could be reproduced with the as-released
            0.55 DBD::Informix but appears to be fixed, presumably by the fix
            for Fred's problem.  Also, ensure the t/dbase.t unsets both
            $ENV{DBI_DSN} and $ENV{DBI_DBNAME} to allow the implicit connect
            test to work (deduced from test output sent by Fred Arnold).
            Move comments about Solaris compiler into new file hints/solaris.
            Move README.M88K.SVR4 to hints/M88K.SVR4.
1997-06-24: Found problems in DBI 0.84 where PrintError, RaiseError, ChopBlanks
            as handled by DBI cannot be unset -- Tim confirmed it is a bug in
            DBI and will be fixed in the next release.
1997-06-23: Core dump problem found by Fred Arnold <ftarnol@uswest.com> in the
            code in link.c and the way it is used.  One part of the problem
            was that the IMPSET flag for a statement was not being set soon
            enough, so that DBI was not releasing the statement from the
            linked lists correctly.  The temporary fix includes a bodge that
            converts the deleted link into a single item linked list, so that
            when it is released again, it doesn't screw things up.  This
            needs to be cleaned up.  A 0.56a1 release was sent to Fred to get
            him over the immediate problem.
1997-06-17: Jason Bodnar <jcbodnar@mail.utexas.edu> pointed out that BEGIN
            WORK is not being recognized via $dbh->do().  Testing showed a
            problem during disconnect on 7.1x servers (related to the B42204
            problem fixed on 97-05-30).  Fixing the disconnect was relatively
            simple.  Fixing the BEGIN WORK issues required the removal of the
            custom implementation of $dbh->do(), and some other changes.
1997-06-13: Where there's one bug, there are usually others.  The other array
            attributes for statements (such as $sth->{NAME}) were not being
            mortalized and could be made to eat up memory if used inside an
            inner loop.  Upgrade non-distributed test bug001.t to catch these
            leaks too.
1997-06-12: Fix trailing blanks on $sth->{NAME} attributes after problem
            reported by Roderich Schupp <roderich@nodebonn.muc.bmw.de>.  Also
            fix t/chopblanks.t not to create VARCHAR columns in SE.
1997-05-30: Fix memory leak when using the $sth->{ix_sqlerrd} and
            $sth->{ix_sqlwarn} attributes repeatedly, reported by Oyvind
            Gjerstad <ogj@tglobe1.tollpost.no>.  The arrays in newSqlerrd()
            and newSqlwarn() were not being mortalized as they should be.
1997-05-30: Only set -Ae on HP-UX when using cc, as reported by Nathan
            Neulinger <nneul@umr.edu> who was using gcc.  Also find and
            implement the CLOSE DATABASE workaround for bugs B42204 and
            B64926 which lead to -1800 errors when a 7.x ESQL/C application
            is talking to a 5.0x engine, also reported by Nathan.
1997-05-29: Add support for $sth->rows and add simple test.
1997-05-26: Add support for DBI->DataSources from DBI v0.82.  Update required
            software accordingly.
1997-05-23: Fix Makefile.PL to recognize $INFORMIXDIR/bin at end of PATH,
            thanks to Paul Kulchenko <paul@mega.donetsk.ua>.
1997-05-20: Change the handling of deprecated attributes per Informix.pm.
            Fix esqltest.ec when the same MODE ANSI database is used for both
            connections (thanks to Kent S Gordon <kgor@inetspace.com> for
            reporting this).

0.55 Bug-Fix Release
--------------------
1997-05-20: ESQL/C Version 5.0x testing previously inadequate, and SQLSTATE
            does not exist in 5.0x, sothe compilation fails.  Also fixed the
            core dumps from t/nulls01.t and t/nulls02.t (nasty workaround)
            and the failure message in t/dbase.t.  Tested with 5.06.UC1,
            6.00.UE1, 7.22.UC2 and 9.10.UC2 on Sun Sparc 20 running Solaris
            2.5.1, using 2 Perl configurations: Perl 5.003 with GCC 2.7.2.2
            and Perl 5.004 with SUNWspro C Compiler SC3.0.1 -- all OK.
            Version 0.55 released.
1997-05-19: Change the handling of deprecated attributes per Informix.pm.

0.54 Release
------------
1997-05-16: Another major rework on Informix.Licence to make the requirements
            clearer to people with minimal exposure to Informix, after Honza
            Pazdziora <adelton@fi.muni.cz> had some problems with it.  Add
            notes from Anibal Jodorcovsky <anibal@nortel.ca> about
            compilation on Motorola M88K SVR4 machines in README.M88K.SVR4.
            Version 0.54 released.
1997-05-15: ChopBlanks code added and tested.  VARCHAR was bad!  Statement
            level ChopBlanks attribute not tested (probably not operational;
            attribute probably remains as it was when the statement was
            prepared).
1997-05-13: Finish adding driver fetch function, and consequential changes.
            SQLSTATE now available via DBI::state!
1997-05-05: Revise ixblob.ec to use ixblob.h and transfer to general library.
            Eliminate BLOB_DUMMY_VALUE and BLOB_NULL_VALUE (can't think what
            they were to be used for!).  Consequential changes.
1997-04-24: Add fix in Makefile.PL for DEC OSF/1 and ESQL/C 7.22 from Andrew
            Hunt <andy@toolshed.com>.  Reverse order of updates in ChangeLog.
            DEC OSF/1 changes also reported later by Debbie Ingram
            <djingram@mindspring.com>.
1997-04-08: Add attribute $sth->{ix_Fetchable} to determine whether the
            statement needs data fetching or not.  Add this to sqlcmd.sh, which
            enables basic simulation of the full SQLCMD program.  Still need
            better Getopt module which allows for multiple occurrences of a
            single option on the command line (eg: multiple -e or -f options).
            Also need better handling of filenames versus commands in the rest
            of the arguments.  Note that the build process does not (yet) do
            anything with the source code of sqlcmd.sh.
1997-04-01: Add '-Ae' for HP-UX unless $Config{ccflags} includes -Aa or -Ae,
            per information from Oyvind Gjerstad <ogj@tglobe1.tollpost.no>.
            Include $Config{ccflags} in the command line when building the
            ESQL/C test program.
1997-03-28: Correct the handling of $dbase2 in multiple connections tests when
            DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE2 is not set.  Fix required after John C
            Hossfeld <john@netpub.com> had problems.  Also report which database
            is being connected to!  Problem (and solution) also subsequently
            reported by James F Miner <jfm@winternet.com>.
1997-03-26: Add ODBC type handling.
1997-03-20: Update Makefile.PL to handle relocated DBIXS.h header, again.
1997-03-18: Change the handling of deprecated attributes per Informix.PM.

0.53 Release
------------
1997-03-06: Change the handling of deprecated attributes per Informix.PM.
            Update the README file to spell out the pre-requisites better.
            Update Makefile.PL with 0.53a1 version number, and so that it
            insists that $INFORMIXDIR is set, and that $INFORMIXDIR/bin is in
            $PATH.  Update tests to use the non-deprecated attributes.  Add the
            test program esqltest.ec to check that the ESQL/C environment is OK
            before creating the Makefile.
1997-03-10: No changes over the weekend - the skiing at Squaw was fabulous!
            Update the POD to encourage the use of DBI->connect() in preference
            to $drh = DBI->install_driver().  Add two new, but fore-shadowed,
            driver attributes, ix_CurrentConnection and ix_ActiveConnections,
            though they're currently only set when the driver is loaded.
1997-03-17: Update Informix.Licence to contain more comprehensive information
            on licencing and Netscape's LiveWire Pro.  Update t/updcursor.t so
            it passes on a logged (non-MODE ANSI) database.  Fix the problem
            with nulls found by Oyvind Gjerstad <ogj@tglobe1.tollpost.no> and
            now immortalized in the test case t/nulls02.t.  Change version to
            0.53 and release.

0.52 Release
------------
1997-03-05: Add ESQL/C => DBD::Informix statement mapping to POD in Informix.PM,
            after suggestion by Bill Mitlyng <Bill.Mitlyng@abnamro.com>.
1997-03-03: Use $DBI::VERSION to determine where DBIXS.h should be found.
1997-03-02: Split attribute handling code from dbdimp.ec into dbdattr.ec.
            Add dbd_ix_module() function.  Revise the interface to the functions
            dbd_st_{FETCH|STORE} to match dbd_db_{FETCH|STORE} (they now take a
            pointer to imp_sth_t argument instead of a pointer to SV).
1997-02-28: Add the Informix.Licence file to explain the licencing issues for
            Informix-ESQL/C.  Update the README file.  Fix the caching of
            attributes.  Add 'deprecated' warning to the system, and a way of
            turning the deprecated warnings off.  Use this method in
            InformixTest.pm.  Add the attribute handling of ix_XyZ as well as
            deprecating the corresponding XyZ attribute.  Fix the handling of
            SQLCA so that the inserted serial number is available, etc.  Version
            bumped to 0.52.

0.51 Release
------------
1997-02-26: Add $sth->{CursorName} and $dbh->{ConnectionName}.  Add test
            updcursor.t to check that you can do 'UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT OF'.
            Add ".DEFAULT." as an explicit way of making the default connection.
            Release version 0.51, and a patch, version 0.51p1.
1997-02-25: Version bumped to 0.51.  Nulls on SELECT handled correctly.  Test
            nulls01.t added.  Notes on access to the SQLCA record added to the
            POD in Informix.PM, after this omission was noted by Torsten Stein
            <stein@cls.de>.
1997-01-23: Fix InformixTest.pm so it works with perldoc.  It seems that perldoc
            does not like lines which start with a single quote.  Thanks to
            Jason Bodnar <jcbodnar@mail.utexas.edu> for pointing this problem
            out. Add and use stmt_err to report errors or warnings, and document
            it.

0.50 Release
------------
1997-02-13: Version 0.50 released.  Handle null database names on connect so
            that CREATE DATABASE, etc, can be used.  ESQL/C 5.0x has to handle
            this by doing nothing (successfully) in dbd_ix_database(), but the
            disconnect code needs to know that there is no database so it
            doesn't try to close the current database.  This requires interface
            changes for dbd_ix_database() and dbd_ix_connect().  Add testing.
            Thanks to Serge Davidov <serge@fcmc.com> for finding the problem.
            You can also use DBI->connect('@server','','','Informix'), which
            actually worked in v0.25.  DBD::Informix is still confused, in
            general, by statements such as CLOSE DATABASE.
1997-01-12: Version bumped to 0.50p1, for consistency with documented intentions
            when 0.25 release was made.

0.26 Release
------------
1997-01-12: Use cursors WITH HOLD when a MODE ANSI database is working with
            AutoCommit set On.  Make transaction tests more sensitive.
            This release never made public.
1997-01-09: Updated copyright messages.  Improved documentation.  Fixed tests.
            Add $dbh->{InTransaction} query.  Clean up dbdimp.ec so that
            AutoCommit works better. Etc.  Version 0.26a2.
1996-12-20: Get transaction stuff to work, more or less, with AutoCommit On or
            Off, in MODE ANSI or Logged databases.  Tests t/transact0[123].t
            added, but these still need to be more formally verified.  They
            pass with OnLine and any type of database.  Clean up various tests
            so that they pass on MODE ANSI databases.  Add select_some_data
            and select_zero_data functions to InformixTest.pm. Etc.  Version
            0.26a1.  Use bug-fixed version of decsci.c (ouch!).
1996-12-19: Add install instructions to README file after Wes Gamble
            <wgamble@informix.com> pointed out this omission.  Add extensive
            notes to Informix.PM on transaction management.  Implement most
            of what those notes say (WITH HOLD cursors omitted at the
            moment).
1996-12-18: Fix bug in patched Makefile.PL (need space before __H_LOCALEDEF).
            Updated dbd_ix_setconnection() to take connection information, and
            updated code in dbdimp.ec to ensure that the correct connection is
            set before starting work.  Simple testing more or less works.  Some
            more major revisions, such as not passing SV* to most of the code in
            dbdimp.ec (let the Informix.c code convert as much as possible to
            plain C).  Rework the 'do' function to completely override
            DBI::_::db::do, avoiding problems with the rows() function.

0.25 Patch 2
------------
1996-12-13: Update Makefile.PL to help the AIX people.  Version 0.25p2 created
            but only the Makefile.PL changes sent to the dbi-users@fugue.com so
            not released officially, though available publicly.

0.25 Patch 1
------------
1996-12-10: Handle 5.00 and 5.01 by supplying actual array names to GET
            DESCRIPTOR, thus bypassing the bug.  Note that it does affect 5.01
            too; edited esql5_00.h to match.  Patch sent to Jeff Rowe who
            confirms it works.  (Note to JL: 5.01 found on Godzilla; what is
            installed as 5.00 is actually 4.10 ESQL/C).  Version 0.25p1 created
            but not released officially or publicly.

0.25 Release
------------
1996-12-09: Finally worked out how SQL descriptors handle blobs.  Code now works
            safely with blobs located in memory.  However, with ESQL/C 7.21.UC1
            on Solaris 2.4, there is a memory leak corresponding to the space
            allocated for the blobs for a given statement unless you manually
            release it before deallocating the descriptor.  This is nasty, and
            may not be true of other versions.  Added test t/blob02.t.  Note
            that t/blob03.t uses the data created by t/blob02.t, so it must be
            run (reasonably successfully) before t/blob03.t can be run
            successfully.  Use decsci.[ch] code (plus auxilliary function
            decgen() inside dbdimp.ec) to format FLOAT, SMALLFLOAT, DECIMAL and
            MONEY quantities.  The 5.0x and 6.0x libraries do not always handle
            these gracefully.

1996-12-05: More revisions to Makefile.PL, some putting teeth into the
            prerequisites, some more dealing with DEC OSF (there's a compiler
            flag to say set __STDC__, as there usually is).  Rename nm_* inside
            the imp_sth structure.  Redefine the type of imp_sth->blobs and
            upgrade code to match.  Test t/blob03.t passes; some work to do to
            get t/blob04.t to pass.  Improved README.  Etc.
1996-12-04: Update Makefile.PL to overcome Dave Thomas problems on DEC OSF
            (version 25.13 sent to him for approval, and comments incorporated
            into version 25.14 .. 25.16).  Also finish converting the tests in
            the t directory.
1996-12-03: Update Makefile.PL (and esqlcc) to use '$(FULLPERL) esqlcc' etc.
            Rename the extratests directory to t for automatic testing as
            documented in the Test::Harness module.  Create (and document)
            InformixTest.pm to help with the test programs.  Note that
            test.pl does not exploit it all that much because it has to test
            some more basic stuff.  However, the other tests do use it.
            NB: ESQL/C 5.00 and 5.01 have a bug in the SQL descriptor code
            which means that using 'char *' as a type restricts you to precisely
            3 characters of data.  This is fixed in 5.02 and above.  Dammit!
1996-12-02: Release 0.25b3 with some work incomplete.  Update Makefile.PL so
            that "make perl" works.  Note that INSERT and blobs does not work!
1996-12-01: Upgrade Makefile.PL to use new Perl scripts esqlcc, esqlsed and
            esqlld to protect platforms such as DEC OSF/1 where the C
            compiler is not used to link shared libraries.  Also, only use
            GCC warnings when DBD_GCC_DEBUG is set in the environment.  Also
            use $(RM_F) to remove the generated C files instead of $(RM) so
            that it works for platforms like SCO where $(RM) is not defined
            by MAKE automatically.
1996-11-30: Move sqlca handling to connection (not statement).
            Fix blob handling to the extent that SELECT works.  (INSERT and
            UPDATE still need fixing.  INSERT will probably be able to adapt
            the SELECT code to handle blobs.  UPDATE will be very tricky.
            Memory leaks may (probably) occur.
            Upgrade Makefile.PL to always set INFORMIXC when compiling ESQL/C.
1996-11-26: Feedback from beta testers incorporated into build process.
            Not all problems will be resolved yet.  Version 0.25b2.
1996-11-25: Changes leading up to 0.25b1 release.  Add sqlca record handling
            for statements.  Add use of EXEC IMMEDIATE when feasible.
1996-11-19: Rewrite of dbdimp.ec more or less complete.  The ESQL/C code
            has been almost totally rewritten; the Perl interface code is
            still similar to what was there previously.  Nearly ready to go
            into release.  5.0x ESQL/C not linking OK on Solaris; not sure
            why.  7.21 is doing fine.
1996-11-01: Control transferred to Jonathan Leffler <johnl@informix.com>.

0.24 Release
------------
1996-09-26: Patches from Terry arrived.  This'll be the 0.25 release.  Seems to
            work.

0.23 Release
------------
1996-09-18: Wrapped in a patch to Makefile.PL from Christophe Martin.  Added
            some other Makefile.PL patches of my own.  It should now support
            cleaner builds on HP-UX (spit!) and correctly detect when dbdimp.ec
            has changed.
1996-09-18: Wrapped in patches by Terry Nightingale based on Bill Hailes'
            isqlperl for supporting multi-cursors.  Cleaned the type handling
            code again.
1996-09-17: Added patch for bad column names as show in George Vicherek's
            splendid test case. (extratests/primitives.pl exercises this)

0.22 Release
------------
1996-09-10: Fixed all numeric types to return correctly.  CHAR fields don't
            quite behave as planned, or perhaps they do.  Added 'multicursor'
            test which proves that simultaneous multiple cursors fail miserably.
1996-09-09: Added @ary = $drh->func('_ListDBs'); method for getting a list of
            extant databases on the local Informix server.  (From original code
            and suggestion by George.Vicherek@Sciatl.COM)

0.21 Release
------------
1995-09-01: Fixed truncated INTEGER bug.  Other numerical types still screwed.
            Patch on the way.

Pre-Release
-----------
1996-04-14: Added support for CREATE, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.  Fixed
            $DBI::errnum and $DBI::errstr problems.  Fixed Informix.pm to stop
            reporting MSQL_HOME errors.  Fixed Makefile.PL.  Removed hacky
            'build' file and uses Makefile.PL exclusively now.
1995-10-17: After a good break of about a month and a half, back in the saddle.
            We have data from SELECTs coming back from the database!  Released
            0.20pl0 Disney on ftp.mcqueen.com.  Limited hacker release.
1995-08-18: Started.  Version 0.0.0 (Totally pre-alpha!)
