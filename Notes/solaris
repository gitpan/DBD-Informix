Error: Undefined symbols __cg92_used at link time.
Environment:  Solaris, GCC

If you compile with the SparcWorks SPARCompiler, you need to add the
command line option on -xcg92 to resolve these symbol problems cleanly.

JL notes: the detailed compiler versions are not known, but SC3.0.1 has not
shown any problems on Solaris 2.4.

This was originally reported for DBD::Oracle; may be relevant to some
versions of Informix-ESQLC on Solaris.  Versions 5.00 through 5.03 of
ESQL/C on Solaris 2.3 used libraries with names of the form libsql_cg92.a
and you may run into problems with these.  (Notably, Makefile.PL will warn
you that your ESQL/C may not be properly installed, even though it actually
is OK.)

Separately, for some reason, the STMT_START and STMT_END macros are not
being created using the 'if (1) ... else (void)0' version of the macros on
Solaris 2.4 with SPARCompiler version 3.0.1, even when -Dsun=1 or -D__sun__
is used on the command line.  I have not managed to figure out why.  This
leads to unwanted warnings about loop termination code not being reached.
