Hi

We have SCO-OpenServer 5.0.4. I compiled my own perl with the optimizing
compiler icc. Dynamic loading do not work with cc. See also comments in
hints/sco.sh of perl-source-distribution. My version fails at some
(hopefully minor) tests. Until now I have ignored this. I have compiled
and tested successfully DBI-0.93 and DBD-Informix-0.58.

Tommi,

Thanks for the information.  I'm not absolutely clear whether you are
reporting what you regard as a successful install of SCO and adding
the warning about using icc instead of cc, or whether you are asking for
help with problems.  If you are reporting success, could you supply the
information shown in the Working.Versions file so I can put a proper
record in place for your system?

Do you have information about the minor test failures?  I may be able
to set your mind at ease...

Yours,
