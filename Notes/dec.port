Pornchai:

When the customer recompiles the ESQL/C application, have them add one of
the following flags to the compile line:

	1.  If using ANSI C compliant code, add a flag of -std1
	2.  If not using ANSI C code, add a flag of -oldc

For example:	esql -oldc demo3.ec -o demo3

This problem is due to a change in the default behavior of the 4.0D C
compiler from prior versions.  The flag -oldc tells the C compiler to
behave as it did under prior versions of the OS.  The flag -std1 will also
get your customer past this problem, but will require ANSI prototyping,
etc, within the source code.
