DBD::Informix --  an Informix interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT IS POSSIBLY UNRELIABLE!

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

*** NOTE: *** perl5 MUST BE INSTALLED TO PATCHLEVEL 'm' AT LEAST!!! *******

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!


BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	build

    If Perl5 is NOT installed install it, and come back here later!

    Then do:

	make
	make install
	./test

If it fails horribly, see below.

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Please post details to perldb-interest@fugue.com and CC them to me at
descarte@hermetica.com.  Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	./test.pl
	./test.pl	(after altering the line with {DebugDispatch} to 2 
			 instead of 0)

2. Full details of which version of Informix/esql and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc or perl5-porters.

6. If you are not currently subscribed to the mailing list please
   also send a subscription request to perldb-interest-request@fugue.com.
